# Roman Numerals Kata
## With Gradle, OOP, Mutation Testing

(Original implementation of this Kata can be found [here](https://github.com/nixlim/romanNumerals))

The purpose of this implementation is to practise the following:

1. Implementation of Roman Numerals conversion algorithm in a way that would 
allow the programmer's intention to be clear from the code - **_PENDING_**
2. Implementation of the OOP principles - **_IN PROGRESS_**
3. Implementation of PI mutation testing - **_SET UP IMPLEMENTED BUT DOES NOT 
WORK AS INTENTED_**
4. TDD - **_ALWAYS_**

## Running Tests

1. Clone repo
2. Run `gradle build`
3. Run `gradle test` - Will run Unit Tests
4. Run `gradle pitest` - Should run mutation tests, but does not work 
properly at the moment
